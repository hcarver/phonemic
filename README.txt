= Phonemic version 1.5, June 26, 2012 =

== Introduction ==
This is the third official release of the Phonemic speech library. Starting with this release, Phonemic now has the ability to run as a daemon speech server, handling multiple client connections over a TCP protocol. 

This new feature allows multiple programs to use the same speech settings at the same time, preventing confusion with multiple voices and cross-talk.

The TCP protocol used by Phonemic in this release is documented at the following Trac page: https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/phonemic/wiki/PhonemicProtocol
